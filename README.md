# Flux-sensor-Communication-glove

This allows people who are paralysed but have limited motion in their fingers to communicate. With the use of 2 fingers they can effectively communicate six Phrases which can be easily customised. This is an affordable, non-intrusive option to help them communicate and can be built by anyone. Design Employs Flex sensors to check motion and then the arduino processes it and displays the output on the screen

You would need the following componenets:

the circuit would look like this:

Again, this is just a simple project that got me started with Uno and sensors but it has super cool real life applications.
